# Bootstrap practice

For this project I've made a website with 3 pages:

 - [Home page](https://dzakh.dev/projects/bootstrap-practice)
 - [About company page](https://dzakh.dev/projects/bootstrap-practice/about.html)
 - [Contacts page](https://dzakh.dev/projects/bootstrap-practice/contacts.html)

## Random afterthoughts

 At first I planed practicing work with bootstrap, it wasn't difficult, but after css grid it was very painful. Also, I used JQuery instead of Native Js, but the project wasn't very big so, I didn't find many places to apply it. And finally Sass, or better to say Scss. This's one of the best things I've ever learned â€” using it was real pleasure for me. Also, during the project I've written [Custom-border-mixin](https://github.com/DZakh/Custom-border-mixin) and [Custom-gutters-bootstrap-plagin](https://github.com/DZakh/Custom-gutters-bootstrap-plagin) on Sass which are worth looking at. With Sass I was able to separate my project into modules that made development easier than in times when all styles were in one place. For this I used 7-1 architecture pattern, which I adopted from the [sass-boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate).  
   
That's all... I'm going to delve into Js next.
